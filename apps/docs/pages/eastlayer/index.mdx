# Introduction to Eastlayer

> TODO: Image here?

Building on Bitcoin presents significant challenges, particularly due to the slow development tools and the time required to synchronize and validate transactions both on the testnet and mainnet. The synchronization process can be a major bottleneck, delaying development timelines by several daysâ€‹.

Currently, developers aiming to create custom applications on Bitcoin often face a waiting period of 5-7 days for off-chain indexing to sync with the mainnet. This slow process hampers innovation and extends development cycles, making Bitcoin a less attractive platform for rapid development compared to other blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, existing indexers are typically centralized, introducing trust issues and reducing the reliability of the off-chain state.

Eastlayer addresses these problems by creating a decentralized data layer for Bitcoin that accelerates development time, enhances composability, provides interoperability, and ensures a trustless system. By decentralizing the indexing process and leveraging a robust testing framework, Eastlayer allows developers to focus on coding and application development rather than being hindered by transaction wait times. This approach not only speeds up the development process but also improves the reliability and security of the applications built on Bitcoin.
