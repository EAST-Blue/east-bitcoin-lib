## Prerequisites

Before you can run the EAST PSBT UI Builder locally, you need to run bitcoin local setup in your local machine to start the bitcoin regtest. Here's how : 
1. Clone the regbox package
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EAST-Blue/east-bitcoin-lib.git regbox & cd regbox
```

2. Build and run regbox
```bash
yarn workspace @east-bitcoin-lib/regbox build && node ./packages/regbox/dist/index.js
```

3. Run this command and it should show the balance of the default wallet
```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=east -rpcpassword=east getbalance
```
