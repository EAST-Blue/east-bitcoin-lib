# Getting started

Using the Smart Index, anyone has the ability to create their own metaprotocol and have it indexed in a decentralized manner. This means that developers can design and implement unique protocols that suit their specific needs, and these protocols will be indexed without relying on a central authority. 

Technically, the Smart Index is a program you develop using AssemblyScript, which then compiles to WebAssembly (WASM) file. Once compiled, you deploy this WASM file to Eastnode. The Smart Index enables you to fetch data from the Eastnode's Bitcoin light client and process it within your code. To manage your metaprotocol data, it allows you to use table for insert, update, delete, and select.
