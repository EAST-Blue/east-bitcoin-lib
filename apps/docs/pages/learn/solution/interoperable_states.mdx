# Interoperable States
The combination of various Bitcoin transaction standards such as PSBT (Partially-Signed), HTLC (Hashed-Timelock), and DLC (Discreet Log Contract) with Eastlayerâ€™s UTXO monitoring, transaction builders, webhooks, and APIs allow the creation of virtual states. These virtual states become a powerful foundation for developing applications and allow interoperability from one virtual state to another.
