# What is RegNet?

RegNet is a Bitcoin test network that focuses on app and metaprotocol development. Unlike the standard 10-minute block times on the main Bitcoin network, RegNet features a faster block time of 10 seconds, facilitating rapid development for developers. This accelerated block times allows developers to test their own apps and metaprotocols without relying on sluggish network or setting up local regtest environment.

RegNet extends beyond a basic Bitcoin core by introducing additional components such as custom API endpoints, an Electrum API, and an Explorer page. These auxiliary tools enhance the development and testing experience. 

For local usage of RegNet, developers can utilize Regbox, an all-in-one node for bitcoin development.
